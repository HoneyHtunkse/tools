Some information for your reference:

"all.syl" file is the syllable segmented file that I collected from several domain including wikipedia Myanmar dump data
and it is also contained some Myanmar corpus that I developed (some are developing ...) with my master and doctoral students.

$ wc all.syl
   7142197  128439493 1241101274 all.syl

I prepared syllable (only prefix) and potma combination frequency files as follows:

$ wc *.freq
   3081    9242   80422 1syl-potma.uniq.freq
  29789  119156  990308 2syl-potma.uniq.freq
 100476  502380 4259628 3syl-potma.uniq.freq
 133346  630778 5330358 total
 
 I used my "sylbreak.pl" perl script for syllable breaking of Myanmar raw text.
 Currently, I only uploaded manually cleaned 1syllable-potma dictionary (filename: 1syl.potma.dict) for your usage.
 
 $ wc ./1syl.potma.dict 
 2325  4650 40299 ./1syl.potma.dict

 It work well for my raw data sentence breaking.
 Of course, this is not the best tool.
 I just want to show how I made sentence breaking for my collected data.
 This method will be useful for sentence breaking of formal Myanmar sentences in someway.
