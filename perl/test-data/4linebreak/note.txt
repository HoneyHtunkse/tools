Some information for your reference:

"all.syl" file is the syllable segmented file that I collected from several domain including wikipedia Myanmar dump data
and it is also contained some Myanmar corpus that I developed (some are developing ...) with my master and doctoral students.

$ wc all.syl
   7142197  128439493 1241101274 all.syl

I prepared syllable (only prefix) and potma combination frequency files as follows:

$ wc *.freq
   3081    9242   80422 1syl-potma.uniq.freq
  29789  119156  990308 2syl-potma.uniq.freq
 100476  502380 4259628 3syl-potma.uniq.freq
 133346  630778 5330358 total
 
 Currently, I only uploaded manually cleaned 1syllable-potma dictionary for your usage.
 
 
 
 It will work well for raw data sentence breaking.
 Of course, this is not the best tool. However, it will be useful for sentence breaking of formal Myanmar sentence in someway.
